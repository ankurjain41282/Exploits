Welcome to CS 6265 Infosec Lab

Introduction
============

This git repository will be your workspace to solve the labs and
problems for this course. It contains lab materials as well as
some utility scripts to help you with the lab.


File layouts
============

The file structure of this repo will look like the following:

$ ls
README		: this file
bin/		: utility scripts
labNN/		: materials for labNN

For each lab, it contains a README file as well as all challenges
as its subdirectories.

$ ls lab01/
README		: information about this lab
bomblab		: challenge bomblab
shellcode32	: challenge shellcode32
...

* Do read those README files as they contain very helpful information
about how to complete each lab and problem, including additional
reference materials and readings.
